# Training Partners Document Similarity
This analystic project seeks to pair personal training clients by text similarity with extracted text from intake forms.

### Extract text
First I used PDF extraction tools to read text from uploading PDF docs.

### Clean Text Data
I used **regular expressions** and **text parsing libraries** to clean the text remove blank lines, numbered lists, questions from the form, personal data, and extranous information to collect important text reflecting client goals, needs, limitations, and customer profiles.
